# Implementation

## Description of algorithm

- `odefun_control1.m`: Apply previous geometric control on SE(3)xR^2 quadrotor suspended with point mass into the offset dynamical model, where we can observe a final configuration error.

- `odefun_control2.m`: Apply improved geometric control on SE(3)xR^2 quadrotor suspended with point mass where there is an offset from the suspension point to the CoM of quadrotor. The desired states are generated by the differential flatness.
